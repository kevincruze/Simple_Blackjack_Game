# Blackjack Game (Python)

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python as a coding project.

## Purpose

The goal of the project is to simulate a game of Blackjack between a player and the dealer, following standard rules:
- Aces can count as 11 or 1
- Dealer must hit until reaching 17
- Player can choose to "Hit" or "Stand"
- Natural Blackjacks are handled at the start

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `blackjack_game.py` in your Python IDE (e.g., VS Code or IDLE).
3. Run the program.
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to play.

## Features

- Deck creation and shuffling
- Player decision: hit or stand
- Ace value adjustment to avoid bust
